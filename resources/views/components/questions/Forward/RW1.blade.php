        <div class="info mx-auto my-4">
            <p>We all take it for granted that the water coming out of our taps has been treated to a high level. Yet drinking water quality varies greatly by region and impurities can enter your supply even from the individual pipes leading to your home.</p>
            <p> We examine what’s really in the tap water we drink every day.</p>
            <h3 class="h5"><b>Chlorine</b></h3>
            <p> Chlorine is used in the water treatment process to kill harmful bacteria and to keep water germ-free when on its journey to your taps. While chlorination is a tried and tested method of disinfecting mains water supplies, it can potentially react with certain naturally occurring organic compounds, producing by-products such as chloroform. Regular monitoring of these compounds in municipal water supplies is, however, required by law so the chances of consuming any harmful substances is extremely small. Whilst the health risks related to chlorine are minimal (and certainly less than the risks posed by inadequate disinfection according to the World Health Organisation) it can impart a strong chemical taste and smell, which can be unpleasant, particularly to those with sensitive palates.</p>
            <h3 class="h5"><b>Limescale</b></h3>
            <p>Limescale is the chalky deposit made up of calcium and magnesium carbonate formed when hard water (i.e. water with high dissolved mineral content) is heated. Water hardness varies greatly by region, with hard water areas seeing greater issues with limescale build up on kettles, coffee machines and taps. Not only does limescale look unsightly but it also affects the efficiency of heating elements in kettles and boilers. The Carbon Trust state that just 1mm of scale will require “a 7% increase in energy input to the boiler to meet the same heat demand”.</p>
            <h3 class="h5"><b>Fluoride</b></h3>    
            <p>Most water supplies naturally contain fluoride at varying levels depending on the source while lead can also find its way into your water though this depends on the presence of old lead water mains in the supply network. Fluoride can occur naturally and there are maximum levels allowed in mains water, though in some regions fluoride is added to municipal water supplies. Artificial fluoridation of mains water has long been a controversial issue with both advocates and critics. Fluoride is medically proven to reduce tooth decay in children and since tooth decay is statistically one of the most widespread chronic diseases in cities, fluoridation schemes have been in place to add it to mains water for around 60 years. But even today, it’s controversial with critics arguing that high levels of fluoride can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis (discolouration and damage to teeth and bones).</p>
            <h3 class="h5"><b>Microplastics</b></h3> 
            <p>Plastic microfibres have been found to contaminate 72% of tap water samples in European nations, including the UK. These microfibres are be believed to come from various sources including clothes made of synthetic fabrics, car tyres, paint and microbeads from cosmetics. To give an idea of the scale of microplastics pollution, a fleece jacket can shed as many as 250,000 microfibres in a single wash. The health risks are still unclear, though microplastics are known to contain and absorb toxic chemicals. Research has also indicated that conditions inside the digestive systems of wild animals could potentially be facilitating the release of those toxins. More research is currently needed to determine the exact effect on human health.</p>
