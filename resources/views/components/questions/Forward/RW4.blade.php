            <b>Subject: Open Day</b> 
            </p>
            <p> Hi everyone <p>
            
            <p>Just writing to tell you about the arrangements for the Open Day next week. Thursday to be exact. The cleaning
            team will have been there all night making the place all clean and shiny and we all have to be in at 8am that’s even
            if your normal start time is 9am. I usually start at 8 anyway so it doesn’t matter to me. Anyway, the doors will open
            to the public at 10am but we don’t expect many to come until the afternoon. Whenever they come there’s no lunch
            option. They will get a chance to see our manufacturing process on a guided tour oh but before that there’ll be a
            welcome speech from our big boss the CEO (not too long we hope!). After the tour they’ll get a chance to sample
            some of the products and finally they’ll be taken to the shop where we hope they spend lots of their lovely money!
            Oh and I forgot, after the CEO speech the local newspaper will take some pics of us all with some members of the
            public.
            Well I think that’s about it. If you need any more info give me a call but not Monday ‘cos I’m off for a long weekend,
            back on Tuesday.
            All the best
            The one and only Jimmy </p>
