            <p>The customer visited our shop one day and selected a T-shirt from our Tropical range of summer clothing for the young and streetwise. Our sales assistant Sam served him and took payment by credit card. When he arrived home, he noticed a small hole in the T-shirt so he brought it back to the shop an hour later. Our sales assistant Alex served him and asked for the receipt but he hadn’t kept it. Alex explained he could not exchange or provide a refund for the T-shirt and he complained to us here at the Head Office, but the response is the same. We can’t exchange or provide a refund for the T-shirt.</p>
